### package.properties

The file `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/package.properties` is generated by the 
package builder, and therefore not part of the repository.
    
Sample content:

<pre>
jquery.version=1.11.0
jquery.mobile.version=1.4.5
jquery.location=jslib-DEVELOPMENT
jquery.js=jquery-1.11.0.min.js
jquery.mobile.js=jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.js
jquery.mobile.css=jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.css
jquery.mobipick.version=0.9
</pre>

Note that in this sample the directory src/main/webapp/jslib-DEVELOPMENT
should be present containing the relevant the files (and sub-directories).
